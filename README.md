# Credit Scoring using Logistic Regression

Credit is a very important product in banking and financial institutions. There is
always a customer in need of a loan. Since Loans are always accompanied by risks, it
is important to identify suitable applicants, and there has to be a means to determine
and separate the good applicants from the bad. To solve this issue, financial
institutions such as banks started developing credit scores.

This project, I will use a logistic regression model to predict the creditworthiness of bank customers using predictors
related to their personal status and financial history. We also compare and evaluate
this algorithms based on the original dataset and transformed dataset using Weighted
of Evidence to draw conclusions
